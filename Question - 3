In JavaScript, an execution context is an internal data structure used to manage the execution of code. It contains information about variables, functions, and the scope chain that are relevant during the execution of a piece of code. Each time a function is called, a new execution context is created, forming a stack of execution contexts known as the "execution stack" or "call stack".
